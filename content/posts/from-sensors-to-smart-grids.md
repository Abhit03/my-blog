The transition to renewable energy isn’t just about building more wind turbines or solar farms.  
It’s equally about **making demand flexible** so that consumption can follow the rhythm of renewable supply.  

At Shared Electric GmbH, we had the opportunity to work on three projects that explored this idea from different angles:  
1. Building an **IoT prototype** to measure and transmit electricity usage.  
2. Developing an **interactive shifting calculator** to demonstrate the value of load flexibility.  
3. Designing a **demand-side management platform** that puts consumers directly in the loop.  

Together, they tell a story of how technology can help bridge the gap between consumers, utilities, and the grid.

## 1. Measuring the Basics: IoT for Real-Time Energy Data

Our journey began with a simple question: *How can we measure electricity consumption cheaply and reliably, at the household level?*  

We built a **low-cost IoT prototype** using Arduino, non-invasive current sensors, and a GPRS module. Every 15 minutes, the device measured household electricity usage and pushed the data to a cloud API.  

This was a proof-of-concept: even with minimal hardware, it was possible to make consumption **visible in real time** and lay the foundation for smarter energy management.

## 2. Making Flexibility Tangible: The Energy Shifting Calculator

Collecting data is valuable, but **data alone doesn’t convince decision-makers**.  
The next challenge was to show utilities and customers what flexibility is *worth* in practical terms.  

We designed an **interactive calculator** that modeled hourly energy demand alongside the available generation sources. The algorithm allocated demand across hours, applying flexibility constraints and calculating which shifts reduced overall cost or CO₂ emissions.  

Implemented in JavaScript with an intuitive web interface, the tool turned abstract optimization into something visual and engaging.  
For the first time, clients could see that even small shifts in usage could lead to **10–20% savings**, a message far more persuasive than a spreadsheet.

## 3. Scaling with People in the Loop: A Demand-Side Management Platform

With measurement and communication in place, the next step was to **put flexibility into practice at scale**.  

We built a **demand-side management platform** that connected utilities and consumers directly.  
- Utilities could request demand shifts at specific hours.  
- The system analyzed hourly consumption data (over **30 million points** across hundreds of installations) to identify flexible users.  
- Personalized messages were sent via app or SMS, nudging people to delay or advance their usage.  
- Responses were tracked and fed back into the model.  

This created a **closed loop**: utilities asked for flexibility, consumers responded, and data confirmed the outcome. It showed that human behavior, when aggregated and guided with the right tools, could act as a resource in its own right.

## Reflections: A Flow of Ideas

Looking back, each project naturally led to the next:  

- The **IoT device** gave us the raw data.  
- The **calculator** made flexibility visible and persuasive.  
- The **DSM platform** put the concept into action with real users.  

Together, these steps illustrated a bigger vision:  
that the future grid will not just be **renewable and digital**, but also **participatory**. Consumers, armed with data and simple nudges, can play an active role in balancing energy systems.  

For me, this journey was a lesson in how **small prototypes evolve into large ideas**. A sensor on an Arduino board can grow into a platform that changes how people and utilities think about energy.
