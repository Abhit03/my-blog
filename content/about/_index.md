title: About
---

I am a computing engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable platforms at the intersection of cloud, edge computing, and AI infrastructure.  

I’ve worked at [CERN](https://home.cern), where I led projects in industrial control, real-time monitoring, and model training workflows on Kubernetes and OpenStack. My work involved deploying platforms on OpenStack Magnum and Red Hat OpenShift, integrating AI/ML pipelines with edge systems, and fine-tuning large language models for domain-specific tasks.  

Before CERN, I worked on demand-side energy management at a renewable energy startup, building IoT prototypes, optimization algorithms, and consumer engagement platforms that processed tens of millions of time-series data points.  

I hold a Master’s degree in Scientific Computing from the University of Heidelberg, Germany.

## Beyond Work
I enjoy writing about AI infrastructure, open-source systems, and energy-tech applications, reflecting on lessons learned from projects spanning IoT prototypes to large-scale AI deployments.
